# Mission_path.cfg = Configuration File containing Mission specific Path Names 
# Path names are relative to single mission directory.
#
# MIP core specific pathes are stored in the main folder in file mip_path.cfg
#
#  All path variable names have to be written in lower case letters!  Maximum Character length=86
#
#  For each path:
#  First row with path variable name and explanation  (do not edit the path variable name!!),
#  Second row with path name: 
#   By default all pathes are given relative to the folder of this file
#   Always ending with a '/'. Changes to absolute pathes are allowed
