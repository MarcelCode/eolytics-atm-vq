# Eolytics ATM v1

### About
This is the very first version of eolytics atm atmospheric correction. This is Frontend/Backend implementation for 
handling the user logic. For the ews processes another server with the mip programs is needed.
The data will be send via rpc between the two backend servers. It is still in production, 
but there is a new version which should become the new standard, see v2.
The Problem was that we created a copy of eolytics wq, but all repositories got new features from time to time.
Thus the eolytics version 1 is pretty inconsistent.
